A destructor is a special member function of a class that is called if an object of that class gets out of scope or 
when the delete expression is used on a pointer to that class's object. A destructor will have the same name as the
class, but it will be prefixed with a tilde(~) , and it will not be able to return any value or take any parameters. 
Destructor can be extremely useful for releasing resizable objects.

Destructor is useful for releasing resources before exiting a program, such as closing files and releasing memories.

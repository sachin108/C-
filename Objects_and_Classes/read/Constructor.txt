A constructor is a special type of member function that is called automatically when an object is created.

A constructor has the same name as that of the class and it does not have a return type.

If we have not defined a constructor in our class, then the C++ compiler will automatically 
create a default constructor with an empty code and no parameters.

A constructor with parameters is known as a parameterized constructor. 

The copy constructor in C++ is used to copy data of one object to another.

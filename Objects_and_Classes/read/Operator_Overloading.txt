In C++, we can change the way operators work for user-defined types like objects and 
structures. This is known as operator overloading. 

For example,
Suppose we have created three objects c1, c2 and result from a class named 
Complex that represents complex numbers.

Since operator overloading allows us to change how operators work, we can redefine
how the + operator works and use it to add the complex numbers of c1 and c2.

We cannot use operator overloading for fundamental data types like int, float, char and so on.

To overload an operator, we use a special operator function. We define the function 
inside the class or structure whose objects/variables we want the overloaded operator 
to work with.

Two operators = and & are already overloaded by default in C++. 
For example, to copy objects of the same class, we can directly use the = operator. 

Operator overloading cannot change the precedence and associativity of operators. 

There are 4 operators that cannot be overloaded in C++. They are:
    :: (scope resolution)
    . (member selection)
    .* (member selection through pointer to function)
    ?: (ternary operator)
